In this repository I have some projects using pure Python.

There is a project where I made a website imitating WhatsApp, where you can actually exchange messages.

Another project with automation to register some products in a database.

Another project where I basically do a complete data analysis and do some simulations of a customer's cancellation, for example.

Another project where I create an Artificial Intelligence and train it so that it can make customer credit predictions.
